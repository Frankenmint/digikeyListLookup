# digikeyListLookup
TINY api script in bash that you can use to lookup lists of urls for components. This is faster than looking them up by hand and works if you need to determine MOQ discounts. Feel free to add in your own optimizations like perhaps breaking out the api lookup string into its own variable that you then string substitute for a list of product ids.

This bash shell script uses jq which isn't sometimes included on linux distros. It allows you to do jQuery like parsing on json results and is a bit cleaner than trying to do the whole find lookups using sed.  

Be sure to register an organization using the digikey api/developers portal then fill in those details in the script. It will generate an access token for you automatically. Those tokens only last five minutes so keep that in mind if you're using a crazy long lookups script. Feel free to modify this to do other things like generate a custom quote or to pull in perhaps the single price if there's not MOQ breakdowns. I did find myself occasionally checking the component on the site because there was no price breakdown.  Also I set the default break quantity to be between 1000 and 20,000. You likely have different requirements so either remove that part or set your filters to whatever works for your use case. Thanks for checking this out!
