# digikeyListLookup
TINY api script in bash that you can use to lookup lists of urls for components. This is faster than looking them up by hand and works if you need to determine MOQ discounts. Feel free to add in your own optimizations like perhaps breaking out the api lookup string into its own variable that you then string substitute for a list of product ids
